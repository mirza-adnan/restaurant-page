# Restaurant Page  
A simple restaurant website rendered entirely using **JavaScript** and a bit of **HTML** and **CSS**. When I say rendered using JS, I mean I generated all the elements through JS. I did this to try and make my code modular and also to try out the export and import system of JS.

## [Live]()  
## Things I learned:
- Using Webpack
- Tabbed Browsing
- Regular exports and default exports
- Importing things
- Using "min-height: 100vh" on the body to make the html element grow along with the body
- Using "flex-grow:1" to make an element take up the remaining space
